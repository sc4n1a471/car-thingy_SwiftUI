# car-thingy_SwiftUI
Ez lenni repository for autós, rendszámos SwiftUI appcuccli

This iOS application is part of the car-thingy system. It acts as a client to both [car-thingy_GO](https://github.com/sc4n1a471/car-thingy_GO) and [car-thingy_Python](https://github.com/sc4n1a471/car-thingy_Python).
What is it good for:
- CRUD operations on cars
- Query license plate using car-thingy_Python, connects to it using plain websocket
- When a car is saved, it also saves the coordinates, so there is a map of all of the cars with markers, colored based on known/unknown boolean
- Shows you stats of the saved cars, currently number of known/unknown cars and saved cars of each brands
